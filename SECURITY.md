# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

The Fluid community has a closed-membership security working group who are available to respond to possible security issues, consisting of a small group of committers to Fluid-related projects.

Any suspected security vulnerabilities can be reported privately by email to [security@fluidproject.org](mailto:security@fluidproject.org). These messages will be forwarded to members of the security working group, who are responsible for working with contributors with relevant expertise and the reporter to address the issue in a timely manner.

Once an issue has been fixed and appropriate patches applied, public announcements will be made at an appropriate time to the [security-announce@fluidproject.org](http://fluidproject.org/mailman/listinfo/security-announce) mailing list. For less severe security concerns, patches will be committed to the source code repository with nondescript log messages.

For more details see the [Security](https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Security) wiki page.
